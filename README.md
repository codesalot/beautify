# Beautify Library
By [@Codesalot](https://github.com/Codesalot). 
### _For making websites prettier_.
This is a CSS library that can be used instead of Bootstrap or other libraries. The documentation files will show what different classes can do.
Beautify will:
* Automatically style a page depending on the styles selected
* Accept multiple stylesheets to be used at one time on a page
* Disable default styles if class is used

Besides making text sizes and font styles better, it also has a lot of other features and classes that can be customized and used to make a page prettier.
