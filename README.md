### _For making websites prettier_.
This is a CSS library that can be used instead of Bootstrap or other libraries. The documentation files will show what different classes can do. 

Besides making text sizes and font styles better, it also has a lot of other features that can be used to make a page prettier.
## Features
Beautify has a lot of different classes for it's styles. It has styles for **[buttons][beautify-buttons]**, **[links][beautify-links]**, and more. If you want to help with Beautify, I would love to have your help developing itðŸ’ž
